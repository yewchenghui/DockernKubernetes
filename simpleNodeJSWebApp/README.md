# simpleNodeJSWebApp
**Requires Docker to be installed**

This folder contains the necessary files for building a basic NodeJS Web App within Docker, with 2 bases.

Consists of the following folders:
- customBuild (building from Alpine)
- nodePreinstalled (using Dockerhub node image)

Refer to respective folder's README for more details.

## Current Observations:
customBuild image takes up lesser space than using nodePreinstalled image.
